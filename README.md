Kerberos Relay and Forwarder for (Fake) RPC/DCOM MiTM Server  

---
KrbRelayEx-RPC is a tool similar to my <a href=https://github.com/decoder-it/KrbRelayEx>KrbRelayEx</a> designed for performing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by relaying Kerberos AP-REQ tickets. <br>
This version implements a fake RPC/DCOM server:<br>
- Listens for authenticated ISystemActivator requests and extracts the AP-REQ tickets
- Extracts dynamic port bindings from EPMAPPER/OXID resolutions
- Relay the AP-REQ to access SMB shares or HTTP ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services) on behalf of the victim on the real destination host
- Forwards the victim's requests dynamically and transparently to the real  destination and port so the  victim is unaware that their requests are being intercepted and relayed.


## Disclaimer  

**This tool is intended exclusively for legitimate testing and assessment purposes, such as penetration testing or security research, with proper authorization.**  
Any misuse of this tool for unauthorized or malicious activities is strictly prohibited and beyond my responsibility as the creator. By using this tool, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
## Why This Tool?  

I created this tool to explore the potential misuse of privileges granted to the `DnsAdmins` group in Active Directory, focusing on their ability to modify DNS records. Members of this group are considered privileged users because they can make changes that impact how computers and services are located within a network. However, despite this level of access, there has been relatively little documentation (apart from CVE-2021-40469) explaining how these privileges might be exploited in practice.

### Beyond DnsAdmins  
Manipulating DNS entries isnâ€™t exclusive to the `DnsAdmins` group. Other scenarios can also enable such attacks, such as:  
- DNS zones with insecure updates enabled 
- Controlling HOSTS file entries on client machines


### Tool Goals  
The goal of this tool was to test whether a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack could be executed by exploiting DNS spoofing, traffic forwarding, and Kerberos relaying. This is particularly relevant because **Kerberos authentication** is commonly used when a resource is accessed via its hostname or fully qualified domain name (FQDN), making it a cornerstone of many corporate networks.

Building upon the concept, I started from the great [KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay) and developed this tool in .NET 8.0 to ensure compatibility across both Windows and GNU/Linux platforms.

## Features  

- Relay Kerberos AP-REQ tickets to access SMB shares or HTTP ADCS endpoints.  
- Interactive or background **multithreaded SMB consoles** for managing multiple connections, enabling file manipulation and the creation/startup of services.  
- **Multithreaded port forwarding** to forward additional traffic from clients to original destination such as RDP, HTTP(S), RPC Mapper, WinRM,...
- Transparent relaying process for **seamless user access**.  
- Cross-platform compatibility with Windows and GNU/Linux via .NET 8.0 SDK.  

---

## Notes  

- **Relay and Forwarding Modes**:  
  KrbRelayEx intercepts and relays the first authentication attempt, then switches to forwarder mode for all subsequent incoming requests. You can press `r` anytime to restart relay mode.  

- **Scenarios for Exploitation**:  
  - Being a member of the `DnsAdmins` group.  
  - Configuring DNS zones with **Insecure Updates**: This misconfiguration allows anonymous users with network access to perform DNS Updates and potentially take over the domain!  
  - **Abusing HOSTS files for hostname spoofing**: By modifying HOSTS file entries on client machines, attackers can redirect hostname or FQDN-based traffic to an arbitrary IP address.  


- **Background Consoles**:  
  These are ideal for managing multiple SMB consoles simultaneously.

###############################################################

Usage:
  KrbRelayEx.exe -spn <SPN> [OPTIONS] [ATTACK]

SMB Attacks:
  -console                       Start an interactive SMB console
  -bgconsole                     Start an interactive SMB console in the background via sockets
  -list                          List available SMB shares on the target system
  -bgconsolestartport            Specify the starting port for background SMB console sockets (default: 10000)
  -secrets                       Dump SAM & LSA secrets from the target system

HTTP Attacks:
  -endpoint <ENDPOINT>           Specify the HTTP endpoint to target (e.g., `CertSrv`)
  -adcs <TEMPLATE>               Generate a certificate using the specified template

Options:
  -redirectserver <IP>           Specify the IP address of the target server for the attack
  -ssl                           Use SSL transport for secure communication
  -spn <SPN>                     Set the Service Principal Name (SPN) for the target service
  -redirectports <PORTS>         Comma-separated list of additional ports to forward (e.g., `3389,135,5985`)
  -smbport <PORT>                Specify the SMB port to listen on (default: 445)

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you configure the entries in your hosts file to point to the actual target IP addresses!

# Examples
SMB Relay:
==========
The *user19* account is a member of the DnsAdmins group in the MYLAB.LOCAL domain. As a member he can modify the A record for SRV2-MYLAB and change the IP 192.168.212.11 which is our attacker machine.
Thee *dnstool.py* script from from https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx can be used for this purpose:<br><br>
<img width="827" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66e4b5d-e1c6-472c-8b40-8951d969df3a">
<br><br>
On the attacker machine, we launch the relay/forwarder tool. SMB consoles will be launched in the background, starting from port 10000, and we will forward all traffic for WinRM, RPC Mapper, and Remote Desktop:<br><br>
<img width="818" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93a31581-bd34-4d0a-8a4f-41d9bad95b2b">
<br><br>
A Domain Admin accesess the \\SRV2-MYLAB\c$ share without suspecting anything:
<br><br>
<img width="851" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/052199fc-c0ba-4505-9125-90b5b2763f16">

<br><br>
We intercept, relay, and forward the authenticated call to the SMB server:<br><br>
<img width="814" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8413f774-0bb4-4cbc-998e-3581b546717e">
<br><br>
Finally, we gain access to the share with privileged permissions:
<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f08aa61c-0657-40c1-924f-753aebb8872b)

<br><br>
From here, we can:

- Write to protected locations with Domain Admin privileges.
- Create and start services that run under the LOCAL SYSTEM context.
 - And much more... ðŸ˜‰

HTTP(s) ADCSRelay:
==================
In this case the Zone MYLAB.LOCAL has been configured with *Unsecure Updates*. Anonymous users with network access can modify DNS records!!<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/920947a6-aae3-47bd-83d7-91c1d05150f4)

<br><br>

We intercept, relay, and forward the authenticated call to the HTTP ADCS server:<br><br>
<img width="965" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f859b23-1603-4eef-92b5-001b21e28624">

<br><br>

Administrator accesses a share of the ADCS Web Enrollment server:<br><br>
<img width="554" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d07c7bc-0394-488d-a26f-51c4c926f1fe">
<br><br>

Finally, we ge a client authentication certificate on behalf the Administrator:<br><br>
<img width="922" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a5795dc-4061-483e-be98-81ab5b89ef8e">
<br><br>
<br><br>
Or we could install a malicious service and get a shell running as SYSTEM
<br><br>

<br><br>
On an ADCS server this would allow the backup of the the CA's private/public key enabling the forging of certificates on behalf of any user.
